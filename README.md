# MalConv-Deep-learning-for-PE-malware-classification

This repository contains the MalConv Architecture trained on EMBER 2018 Dataset to classify the PE file as benign or malware. 
There  are three coding files:
  1. MalConv Training https://github.com/iBibek/MalConv-Deep-learning-for-PE-malware-classification/blob/main/MalConv_Malware_Classification_of_PE_files.ipynb 
  2. Model Deployment: https://github.com/iBibek/MalConv-Deep-learning-for-PE-malware-classification/blob/main/Model_Deployment.ipynb
  3. ClientPE File: https://github.com/iBibek/MalConv-Deep-learning-for-PE-malware-classification/blob/main/clientPE.py
